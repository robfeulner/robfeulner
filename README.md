# Rob Feulner

### Rob Feulner (b. 1987) is a full stack web developer and video artist hailing from Montr√©al, Qu√©bec. Armed with a stack of VCRs, circuit-bent equipment, and a disregard for electrical shocks, Rob Feulner dives wrist-deep into open machinery to manipulate tape heads and moving parts, creating a landscape of video tracking errors and glitches used to confront modern political malaise. His work has appeared in the Indianapolis Museum of Art, has been broadcasted by The Cartoon Network, and performed alongside MacArthur Fellowship prize winner Anne Carson during a performance of her play Antigone. Established in 2014, Feulner's video art label Bleu Nuit Video curates underrepresented like-minded artists through DVD and VHS home releases. **He is a recent graduate of Concordia University's Full Stack Web Development bootcamp.**
